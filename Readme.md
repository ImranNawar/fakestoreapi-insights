1. List all the products with above average price.
2. List the top 5 products with the highest rating.
3. List all distinct categories.
4. Print the average price and rating of the products.
5. List the top 5 products with the highest rating and the lowest price.
6. Create a list with User's Name, Email, City, along with their purchased product's names, prices, and total bill. Add this list to the DOM and style it using Bootstrap 5.
